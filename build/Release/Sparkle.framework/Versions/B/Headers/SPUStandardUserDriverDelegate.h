 If this delegate method is not implemented, Sparkle will instead offer to open the

 If this delegate method is implemented, Sparkle will instead ask the delegate to show the full release notes to the user.
 A delegate may want to implement this method if they want to show in-app or offline release notes.

 Visit https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/gentle-reminders for more information and examples.

/**
 Specifies if the standard user driver should handle showing a new scheduled update, or if its delegate should handle showing the update instead.
 
 If you implement this method and return @c NO the delegate is then responsible for showing the update,
 which must be implemented and done in `-standardUserDriverWillHandleShowingUpdate:forUpdate:state:`
 The motivation for the delegate being responsible for showing updates is to override Sparkle's default behavior
 and add gentle reminders for new updates.
 
 Returning @c YES is the default behavior and allows the standard user driver to handle showing the update.
 
 If the standard user driver handles showing the update, `immediateFocus` reflects whether or not it will show the update in immediate and utmost focus.
 The standard user driver may choose to show the update in immediate and utmost focus when the app was launched recently
 or the system has been idle for some time.
 
 If `immediateFocus` is @c NO the standard user driver may want to defer showing the update until the user comes back to the app.
 For background running applications, when `immediateFocus` is  @c NO the standard user driver will always want to show
 the update alert immediately, but behind other running applications or behind the app's own windows if it's currently active.
 
 There should be no side effects made when implementing this method so you should just return @c YES or @c NO
 You will also want to implement `-standardUserDriverWillHandleShowingUpdate:forUpdate:state:` for adding additional update reminders.
 
 This method is not called for user-initiated update checks. The standard user driver always handles those.
 
 Visit https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/gentle-reminders for more information and examples.
 
 @param update The update the standard user driver should show.
 @param immediateFocus If @c immediateFocus is @c YES, then the standard user driver proposes to show the update in immediate and utmost focus. See discussion for more details.
 
 @return @c YES if the standard user should handle showing the scheduled update (default behavior), otherwise @c NO if the delegate handles showing it.

/**
 Called before an update will be shown to the user.
 
 If the standard user driver handles showing the update, `handleShowingUpdate` will be `YES`.
 Please see `-standardUserDriverShouldHandleShowingScheduledUpdate:andInImmediateFocus:` for how the standard user driver
 may handle showing scheduled updates when `handleShowingUpdate` is `YES` and `state.userInitiated` is `NO`.
 
 If the delegate declared it handles showing the update by returning @c NO in `-standardUserDriverShouldHandleShowingScheduledUpdate:andInImmediateFocus:`
 then the delegate should handle showing update reminders in this method, or at some later point.
 In this case, `handleShowingUpdate` will be @c NO.
 To bring the update alert in focus, you may call `-[SPUStandardUpdaterController checkForUpdates:]` or `-[SPUUpdater checkForUpdates]`.
 You may want to show additional UI indicators in your application that will show this update in focus
 and want to dismiss additional UI indicators in `-standardUserDriverWillFinishUpdateSession` or `-standardUserDriverDidReceiveUserAttentionForUpdate:`
  
 If `state.userInitiated` is @c YES then the standard user driver always handles showing the new update and `handleShowingUpdate` will be @c YES.
 In this case, it may still be useful for the delegate to intercept this method right before a new update will be shown.
 
 This method is not called when bringing an update that has already been presented back in focus.
 
 Visit https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/gentle-reminders for more information and examples.
 
 @param handleShowingUpdate @c YES if the standard user driver handles showing the update, otherwise @c NO if the delegate handles showing the update.
 @param update The update that will be shown.
