## Advanced

### Ignore Copied Items

You can tell Maccy to ignore all copied items:

```sh
defaults write org.p0deje.Maccy ignoreEvents true # default is false
```

This is useful if you have some workflow for copying sensitive data. You can set `ignoreEvents` to true, copy the data and set `ignoreEvents` back to false.

You can also click the menu icon with <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> pressed. To ignore only the next copy, click with <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT (⇧)</kbd> pressed.

### Ignore Custom Copy Types

By default Maccy will ignore certain copy types that are considered to be confidential
or temporary. The default list always include the following types:

* `org.nspasteboard.TransientType`
* `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`
* `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType`

Also, default configuration includes the following types but they can be removed
or overwritten:

* `com.agilebits.onepassword`
* `com.typeit4me.clipping`
* `de.petermaurer.TransientPasteboardType`
* `Pasteboard generator type`
* `net.antelle.keeweb`

You can add additional custom types using preferences or `defaults`:

```sh
defaults write org.p0deje.Maccy ignoredPasteboardTypes -array-add "com.myapp.CustomType"
```

If you need to find what custom types are used by an application, you can use
free application [Pasteboard-Viewer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Pasteboard-Viewer).
Simply download the application, open it, copy something from the application you
want to ignore and look for any custom types in the left sidebar. [Here is an example
of using this approach to ignore Adobe InDesign](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/issues/125).

If you accidentally removed default types, you can restore the original configuration:

```sh
defaults write org.p0deje.Maccy ignoredPasteboardTypes -array "de.petermaurer.TransientPasteboardType" "com.typeit4me.clipping" "Pasteboard generator type" "com.agilebits.onepassword" "net.antelle.keeweb"
```

### Speed up Clipboard Check Interval

By default, Maccy checks clipboard every 500 ms, which should be enough for most users. If you want
to speed it up, you can change it with `defaults`:

```sh
defaults write org.p0deje.Maccy clipboardCheckInterval 0.1 # 100 ms
```

## FAQ

### Why doesn't it paste when I select an item in history?

1. Make sure you have "Paste automatically" enabled in Preferences.
2. Make sure "Maccy" is added to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.

### When assigning a hotkey to open Maccy, it says that this hotkey is already used in some system setting.

1. Open System settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts.
2. Find where that hotkey is used. For example, "Convert text to simplified Chinese" is under Services -> Text.
3. Disable that hotkey or remove assigned combination ([screenshot](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/assets/576152/446719e6-c3e5-4eb0-95fb-5a811066487f)).
4. Restart Maccy.
5. Assign hotkey in Maccy settings.

### How to restore hidden footer?

1. Open Maccy window.
2. Press ⌘, to open preferences.
3. Enable footer in Appearance section.

If for some reason it doesn't work, run the following command in Terminal.app:

```sh
defaults delete org.p0deje.Maccy hideFooter
```

## Motivation

There are dozens of similar applications out there, so why build another?
Over the past years since I moved from Linux to macOS, I struggled to find
a clipboard manager that is as free and simple as [Parcellite](http://parcellite.sourceforge.net),
but I couldn't. So I've decided to build one.

Also, I wanted to learn Swift and get acquainted with macOS application development.
